# CVE-2024-47176: Remote Command Execution in CUPS
##Description
CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) is an open-source printing system that handles networked printers. CVE-2024-47176 specifically targets the cups-browsed functionality, which binds to INADDR_ANY:631, allowing it to trust any packet from any source. By manipulating the Get-Printer-Attributes IPP request, an attacker can send malicious print jobs from a remote system, leading to arbitrary command execution when combined with other vulnerabilities such as CVE-2024-47076 and CVE-2024-47175.
## Steps to Exploit CVE-2024-47176

### Prerequisites
- Access to the target machine with port 631 (IPP) exposed to the internet.
- Python installed on your local machine (for running the exploit script).
- `nmap` installed for scanning the target.

---

### Step 1: Scanning for Open Ports
Use **nmap** to scan the target machine and confirm if port `631` is open, as this is used by CUPS.

```bash
nmap -sS -p631 <target-ip>
